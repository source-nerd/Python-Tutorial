# Welcome to Python Tutorial


This is a brief Python 3 programming tutorial who want to either brush up or learn Python as a programming language. I have tried to show everything in simple & plain language executed in Jupyter Notebook.

This tutorial is aimed at people with some prior programming experience. Since, there are few tutorials in basics now but we will quickly be diving into advanced py stuff.

**Requirements**: You are free to use Python 3.3 or above. Don't use Python 2.x as they are slowly fading away. Again you can use Python 2 but someone will have to convert it to Python 3 so its best to use Python 3.

> Note: This tutorial does not aims to provide you the basic instruction like What is Python, Installation Notes, etc. You are free to discuss it or you can post it in Issues section if you feel something is incorrect or if you want something to be incorporated.

## Contents
This tutorial as of now contains only one section. The list will be updated shortly once I complete my code. **Collaborators are most welcome.**

**BASICS**
1. Python Basics
2. Data Structures in Python
3. Lambda, Map, Filter Functions

##  Project Instructions
Feel free to clone this repo or download it.
Then follow the following steps in-order to run it properly in your local machine.
1. Initialize the Project folder in virtual environment.
2. Make sure to install the complete `requirements.txt`: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. And then you are all set, you can execute the code cell by cell and test it your self.

> Note: If you are having issue in initializing the project as virtual env then do let me know. You can post it in the issues section.

## Feedback
It may not be very optimized, so if you tend to find any bug fixes, feature requests, pull requests, feedback, etc., are welcome...
If you like this tutorial, please do give it a star.
